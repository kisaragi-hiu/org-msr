* org-msr

Minimal Spaced Repetition setup for Org mode.

** Usage
Run ~org-msr-setup~ in a Org mode file to
- add file TODO keywords according to =org-msr-keyword-frequency-alist=
- start ~org-msr-mode~ automatically when visiting it.

Now for each heading you want to remember, run ~org-todo~ and select how frequently you want to see it. A repeater will automatically be added and updated, and you can see all items in your org-agenda.

I recommend using =org-super-agenda= and a filetag so that the =org-msr= entries donâ€™t bury everything else.

In your init:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-super-agenda-groups '((:name "Vocabulary"
                                         :tag "org-msr"
                                         :order 100)))
#+END_SRC

In the Org file:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+FILETAGS: :org-msr:
#+END_SRC
